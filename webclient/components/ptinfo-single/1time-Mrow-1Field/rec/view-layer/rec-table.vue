    Why? If Ct is already mounted I do not want to do 3 things have already happened
        For the description of the 3 things read Line 65,74,83
        For e.g. If I let search.insert happen multiple times then in the search dropdown multiple results will come
    Why not use keepalive?    
        Sorrounding component with keepAlive in pf/_uuid/index.vue does not help. Since previous rendering of rex
        is not hidden. When user types rex 2 times, rex is being displayed 2 times
