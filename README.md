Todo:

1. Correlate graph to be responsive
2. Store split value used in \_pf/index.vue inside commonForAllCt
3. when left drawer opens make this value 65% for the right side and vice versa.

4. right click menu: https://vmaimone.github.io/vue-context-menu/
5. From current note invoke change component where I can add / change
6. Content assist
7. Dont show prev and next if it is the first or last note.
8. Slider value does not change when prev and next inside note is clicked
9. On some prev and next multiple icons on the timeline are becoming green
10. On page load none of the actions should be active in the header slider.

Context menu features needed:

1. Tree of menus

https://randallwilk.dev/docs/vue-context/v6/demos/advanced#nested-menus: Yes

2. Cut and paste still works
